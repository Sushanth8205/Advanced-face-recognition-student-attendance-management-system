In colleges, universities, organizations, schools, and offices, taking attendance is one of the most important tasks that must be done on a daily basis. The majority of the time, it is done manually, such as by calling by name or by roll number. The main goal of this project is to create a Face Recognition-based attendance system that will turn this manual process into an automated one. This project meets the requirements for bringing modernization to the way attendance is handled, as well as the criteria for time management. This device is installed in the classroom, where student's information, such as name, roll number, class, sec, and photographs is trained. The images are extracted using Open CV. Before the start of the corresponding class, the student can approach the machine, which will begin taking pictures and comparing them to the qualified dataset.
